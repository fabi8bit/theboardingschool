# The Boarding School Skateboards

The Boarding School (TBS skateboarding) is the website of a skateboard school specializing in longboarding. The school offers lessons and instruction on how to ride a longboard, which is a type of skateboard that is generally longer and wider than a traditional skateboard. It offers classes for beginners as well as more advanced riders, and covers topics such as balance, carving, turning, braking, and tricks. TBS aims to gather people ranging from 18 years old and older, around longboarding. It offers not only programs specialized in various disciplines of longboarding, but also opportunities for people with an interest for the skateboard culture to chat together.

## Development of the idea

### Where the idea comes from

I'm almost 50 years old and I'm passionate about skateboarding since I was 11 years old. With my age is basically impossible to skate as you wish unless you are Tony Hawk and because once you are a skater you are gonna be a skater for the rest of your life (but not your body) I thought it is a good idea to invent a skateboard school: TBS Skateboarding.

### Features

- __Header__

  - the header is divided in two parts, the logo, and the navigation bar. This structure is replicated in all the pages of the site in order to give the optimal user experience possible. The logo has a spin animation on load in order to give the impression that rolls as a skateboard wheel. The navigation bar permits to navigate the site back and forth without the use of the back button of the browser.
  - this section is fully responsive and adapts to different screens sizes, changing the position of the elements accordingly to the screen aspect ratios.

- __School Offer__
  
  - In this section the offer of the school is displayed by images with a brief description. In the future every section will be clickable and will bring the user to the page where every discipline is described in depth with a small demostrative video with basic tutorials to move the first steps into longboarding.
